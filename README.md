Reference to Array for C++
==========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/array_view.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/array_view)


References to array are very common in C++ programs.  In good old C programs, references to array are represented as a pointer and its length like `void f(int const* ptr, size_t len)`.  In C++, references to array are represented using template parameter like `template<size_t N> void f(int (&arr)[N])`.  And C++ has many useful array classes like `std::array`, `std::vector` and so on.  `array_view` can deal all of them with safe and unified way.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "array_view.hpp"

void show_int_array(arv::array_view<int> view)
{
    for(auto const& e : view) {
        std::cout << e << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    int good_old_c_array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::array<int, 4> array = {{1, 2, 3, 4}};
    std::vector<int> vector = {1, 2, 3, 4};

    // access arrays with safe and unified way
    show_int_array(good_old_c_array);
    show_int_array(array);
    show_int_array(vector);
    show_int_array({1, 2, 3, 4});

    return 0;
}
```

## Installation

Copy files in `include/` to a directory in include paths.

```
cp include/* path/to/include-dir/
```

## More Usage

When you want to use `array_view` explicitly, use `make_view()`.

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
auto av = arv::make_view(v);
```

If you want to output `array_view`, include `array_view_output.hpp` and just use `<<`.

```cpp
#include "array_view_output.hpp"
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::cout << arv::make_view(v); // "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}" is output
```

You can slice `array_view` to make new sub-array references.

```cpp
std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
auto av = arv::make_view(v);
auto sub_av = av.slice(/*position*/ 2, /*length*/ 2);
std::cout << sub_av; // {3, 4}
```

## Why don't you use `boost::range`?

I use this library in my job.  Just try to feel what I feel.
